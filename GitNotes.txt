Notes:

1. Git initialisation required when we create any directory.
#git init

2. Show hidden files
#ls -la

3. Always give a meaningful message in commit

4. When any file change is made then the file is highlighted as changed, need to add it to git to commit.
#git add <filename>
Or to add everything changed 
#git add .
